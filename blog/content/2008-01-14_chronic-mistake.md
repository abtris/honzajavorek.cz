Large flow of some ragged clouds  
hides a land of helpless shouts  
comin' from an isolated keep  
where the Acts with the Valour sleep.

Here the lord still blocks the gate  
until he'll see that it's too late  
to let the knowledge in  
to the keep of colour green.

But not a glitterin' sword  
can conquer the mind of the lord  
'cause mind can be changed  
only from the inner range.
