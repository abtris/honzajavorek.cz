There are too many ways to live  
you can stay or you can leave

Well, it's so easy to stay  
but all around is a gloom  
and you can became a prey  
with destiny in a doom

However, you can change  
just throw away your moan  
and really shift the range  
turn it all… up side down

Be independent, or just free  
be fresh as a river source  
be crazy like a storm at sea  
and be happy, and be yours

Something happened here  
nothing nice and nothing clear

But there are so many ways to live  
you can stay… or you can leave
