Stub, stub, tree.  
Yes, they were three.  
In heaven are the two  
so what should the last do?

Beautiful time has gone  
and now? Alone. Alone.  
Without him and without her  
no more lovely magic smell.

Don't be sad, my dear  
play with stubs – still are here  
but please, do not really try  
touch the heaven, look at sky.

Beware of touches. And no winks!  
Monumental plan? Now sinks  
like one of little maple leaves.  
Humour gets bad. Energy leaves.

You know, still the tree  
can say „I'm free“  
but it's really why to cry  
if „we“ cannot change the „I“.
