Large flow of some ragged clouds
 hides a land of helpless shouts
 comin' from an isolated keep
 where the Acts with the Valour sleep.

Here the lord still blocks the gate
 until he'll see that it's too late
 to let the knowledge in
 to the keep of colour green.

But not a glitterin' sword
 can conquer the mind of the lord
 'cause mind can be changed
 only from the inner range.
