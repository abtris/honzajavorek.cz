Listening emotive song,
 while whole night is so sad,
 wishing something wrong,
 and hoping for something bad.

She's so lovely and so smart...
 Her charm... Touches my heart!
<!--more-->

But!

The point comes,
 to break these rhymes...

She's forbidden.
 Just not available...

The girl loves someone else.
 And I think someone worse.

Probably.

So, no emotion... Just slow down...
 Show must go on. Show for this clown.
