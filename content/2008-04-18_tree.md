Stub, stub, tree.<br>
Yes, they were three.<br>
In heaven are the two<br>
so what should the last do?

Beautiful time has gone<br>
and now? Alone. Alone.<br>
Without him and without her<br>
no more lovely magic smell.

Don't be sad, my dear<br>
play with stubs – still are here<br>
but please, do not really try<br>
touch the heaven, look at sky.

Beware of touches. And no winks!<br>
Monumental plan? Now sinks<br>
like one of little maple leaves.<br>
Humour gets bad. Energy leaves.

You know, still the tree<br>
can say „I'm free“<br>
but it's really why to cry<br>
if „we“ cannot change the „I“.
