A Zimbabwean, a Czech, a Jew, an Italian from the Netherlands, a [Peace Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_Corps) volunteer, a Namibian [PSF Fellow](https://www.python.org/psf/fellows/), and Elvis walk out of their cars to the oldest and driest desert in the world. You know, just to have a little stretch after a 300 km long drive, and to take a few pictures. No, that's not a beginning of an overly complicated joke. That's what can happen to you as an attendee of the [PyCon Namibia](https://na.pycon.org/).
