Large flow of some ragged clouds<br>
hides a land of helpless shouts<br>
comin' from an isolated keep<br>
where the Acts with the Valour sleep.

Here the lord still blocks the gate<br>
until he'll see that it's too late<br>
to let the knowledge in<br>
to the keep of colour green.

But not a glitterin' sword<br>
can conquer the mind of the lord<br>
'cause mind can be changed<br>
only from the inner range.
