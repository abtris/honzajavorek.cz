## Software Engineer
### Web APIs

I sit on chair and type on keyboard, all day long, in a factory building located within one of [Prague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague)'s flood zones.
The thing we're working on is hard to explain, but it involves all the things
important for success in the First World, such as [coffee, thinking, whiteboards,
Doge and beards](http://blog.apiary.io/2016/01/24/Making-of-Peacock/), so trust me,
it's the next big thing, we'll be rich.

HTTP, REST, JSON, [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/), [MSON](https://github.com/apiaryio/mson), Hypermedia, holy dissertations, best practices of API Design. My job and my passion. [Apiary](https://apiary.io/) pays me to write structured code in Node.js or Python and annoying, unbearably long e-mails about code linters. Since 2016 I work on [Dredd](https://github.com/apiaryio/dredd), an open source framework for testing Web APIs. I currently don't offer any trainings and no, I'm not looking for a new job, but I'll gladly speak at your event.

## Activist on Mission
### Czech Python User Group

I can't fix printers and I suck in math. I compensate it by writing
long texts and being talkative. Since my friends didn't want to listen to me
anymore, I started [religious](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) meetups where people adore me and think I'm saying smart things. We spread our belief by helping innocent people to learn programming.

I founded local Python user groups in Brno and Ostrava, created [python.cz](http://python.cz/en) and supported country-wide collaboration of all user groups under an umbrella non-profit, [Pyvec](http://pyvec.org/en/). I'm involved in most local events and activities, such as [Pyvo](http://pyvo.cz/en/), [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/events/map/), [PyLadies](http://pyladies.cz/), [PyCon CZ](https://cz.pycon.org/). Since 2015 I focus mainly on helping people to learn programming from scratch using Python and on making the existing community more friendly to beginners.
