There are too many ways to live<br>
you can stay or you can leave

Well, it's so easy to stay<br>
but all around is a gloom<br>
and you can became a prey<br>
with destiny in a doom

However, you can change<br>
just throw away your moan<br>
and really shift the range<br>
turn it all… up side down

Be independent, or just free<br>
be fresh as a river source<br>
be crazy like a storm at sea<br>
and be happy, and be yours

Something happened here<br>
nothing nice and nothing clear

But there are so many ways to live<br>
you can stay… or you can leave
