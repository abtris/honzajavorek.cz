Listening emotive song,  
while whole night is so sad,  
wishing something wrong,  
and hoping for something bad.

She's so lovely and so smart…  
Her charm… Touches my heart!

But!

The point comes,  
to break these rhymes…

She's forbidden.  
Just not available…

The girl loves someone else.  
And I think someone worse.

Probably.

So, no emotion… Just slow down…  
Show must go on. Show for this clown.
