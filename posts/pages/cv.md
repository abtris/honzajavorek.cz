I am Honza Javorek, freelance web apps creator from Brno, Czech Republic.

## I am

I am systematic and precise. Communicative, flexible, able to learn new stuff. If I believe my work makes sense, I can do impossible. I love to analyze and solve unconventional, challenging problems. I hate routine tasks without need of invention.

## I love, I learn

In 2010 I switched to Python after 5 years of professional PHP experience. I fell in love with it immediately. I am very passionate about getting as much experienced in Python as possible in the shortest time I can.

I learn every day. On top of my finished [university education](http://www.linkedin.com/in/honzajavorek#profile-education) I instantly seek for information about new technologies and trends.

## I code

I was a part of a team working on very complex SaaS app for film festivals, [Eventival](http://www.eventival.com/). [I freelanced 5 years](http://www.linkedin.com/in/honzajavorek#profile-experience) to get a [lot of experience](http://www.linkedin.com/in/honzajavorek#profile-skills) with creating many commercial sites, e-shops, portals, intranets, and some hobby sites. I worked on projects for both ordinary and web dev companies, but also for [large financial institutions](http://www.generali.cz).

I created Facebook mashup [ConcertIn](https://apps.facebook.com/concertin/) recommending users to which concerts they might like to go. I designed and built rather large app [Mergado](http://www.mergado.cz), *feedburner for e-shops*, which is processing hundreds of XML exports daily. In my free time I code [Žít kino](http://zitkino.cz/), Brno cinema showtimes overview site and I started [python.cz](http://python.cz/) as a junction point for Czech Python community.

## I share

I wrote [several articles](http://www.linkedin.com/in/honzajavorek#profile-publications) for Czech online magazine for web developers, [Zdroják](http://zdrojak.cz). I also run my own blog here on [honzajavorek.cz](http://honzajavorek.cz). Sometimes I give a little presentation about an interesting topic on some local meetups (e.g. about [CSS preprocessors](https://speakerdeck.com/u/honzajavorek/p/jak-z-css-vymacknout-maximum) or [Celery](https://speakerdeck.com/u/honzajavorek/p/jak-prezit-frontu-a-nepredbihat)).

## I attend, I organize

I like to join local professional communities. I attended local Barcamps and developer days of Google or Seznam. Since it has started back in 2008, I didn't miss any [Prague WebExpo conference](http://www.webexpo.net). I was on [RuPy 2012](http://rupy.eu/).

As there was only weak local Python community in Brno, I started [PyVo](http://twitter.com/napyvo) meetup and I organize regular monthly events with *talks & beer*.
